THESE IS THE GRAMMER THAT I HAVE DECIDED FOR THE LANGUAGE.
NAME OF THE LANGUAGE IS: "Dude's Awesome Dedication, Determination and Yearning" (DADDY)

okay so i am going to write an interpreter in next ten days,
a very basic interpreter in golang which has

function -> phi
operations -> +-*/=
keywords -> return, let
delimiters -> {}, (), @
comment -> $

i am going to write tokens, lexers, parser,ast for above-mentioned
things first, then extend it to have conditionals, and if-else statements.
if-else-> no else but ifNOT and no else if but orIF
if condition then{

}orIF condition then{

}ifNOT{

}

conditionals->
== -> equals
> -> greater than
>e -> greater than equals to 
< -> less than
<e -> less than equals to
NOT== -> not equals to

these language will not have switch-cases.

loops-> there will only be one loop
using range
from [index] to [index] in range [datastructure] do{
	:	$ loops and conditionals statements will start from ':'
}
without range
from [number] to [number] do{
	:
}
